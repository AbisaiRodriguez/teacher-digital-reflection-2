              Jamboard- If there is one thing I can thank virtual learning for,
              it's definitely learning how to incorporate jamboards into almost
              everything we do in 5th grade. Jamboards are essentially a super
              modern digital whiteboard that you can use to highlight, write,
              add text, add sticky notes, and even add images to. All you have
              to do is set the background to whatever worksheet/notes or graphic
              organizer you need. They are so much more engaging than a google
              doc or workbook page. I will continue to use this digital tool
              even when i’m back to teaching in person. Highly recommended!
              10/10!

              Google Slides- Here is another tool I would not have survived
              virtual learning without. In fact, I created a virtual classroom
              and daily agendas on google slides. Google slides are pretty user
              friendly so I just made a copy of a weekly template I had for each
              day. Everything was hyperlinked for my students to access easily.
              You can also use slides for teaching, guided/independent practice
              and anything you can possibly think of. This is another tool I
              can’t live without as a teacher.

              Game Programs for anything and everything- Quizizz, Kahoot, and
              Blooket are not only a great way to formatively assess students,
              but they are also just really fun! Sometimes I even log in so my
              students can try to “beat the teacher” It hasn’t happened yet, but
              they can keep trying. Students tend to be pretty competitive so
              these are always a fun thing to incorporate into your teaching.
