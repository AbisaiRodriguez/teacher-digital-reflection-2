            <h1>Hi there!</h1>
            <p>
              My name is Elizabeth Murillo-Rodriguez. I'm a 5th grade teacher in
              Perris Elementary School District. Being born and raised in
              Perris, this is the school district I grew up in. After high
              school, I moved away to San Diego for college and have lived in
              the county ever since. When I got hired at PESD, I was so excited
              to be a part of the district that I grew up in. In addition, I am
              colleagues with some of my former teachers, which is strange but
              awesome. When Iâ€™m not teaching I enjoy relaxing while watching TV,
              being outdoors, and spending time with my husband. Thank you for
              stopping by.

          <h1>My Teaching Philosophy</h1>
          <p>
            As a teacher, I believe that all students have the right to learn
            and reach their full potential, no matter what their circumstance
            may be. I understand that all students are unique, and learn in
            different ways. My goal will be to provide and nurture a learning
            environment in which all students feel safe, cared for, and
            challenged to always reach their full potential.<br />
            In my classroom, I will always encourage students to share their
            ideas and nurture a growth mindset. I will strive to remind students
            that every time they try new and hard tasks, their brain is growing.
            I will present students with a curriculum that incorporates
            collaborative learning, hands on activities , and technology. I will
            always try my best to differentiate instructions to meet the needs
            of all my students, and incorporate their interests into their
            learning for engagement. I believe that all students have a right to
            learn , and have fun while they're doing it.
