                  My name is Elizabeth Murillo-Rodriguez. I'm a 5th grade
                  teacher in Perris Elementary School District. This is the
                  school district I grew up in! Yes, I am now colleagues with
                  some of my former teachers, which is really awesome! Thank you
                  for stopping by.

            <h1>My Teaching Philosophy</h1>
            <p>
              As a teacher, I believe that all students have the right to learn
              and reach their full potential, no matter what their circumstance
              may be. I understand that all students are unique, and learn in
              different ways. My goal will be to provide and nurture a learning
              environment in which all students feel safe, cared for, and
              challenged to always reach their full potential.<br />
              In my classroom, I will always encourage students to share their
              ideas and nurture a growth mindset. I will strive to remind
              students that every time they try new and hard tasks, their brain
              is growing. I will present students with a curriculum that
              incorporates collaborative learning, hands on activities , and
              technology. I will always try my best to differentiate
              instructions to meet the needs of all my students, and incorporate
              their interests into their learning for engagement. I believe that
              all students have a right to learn , and have fun while they're
              doing it.
