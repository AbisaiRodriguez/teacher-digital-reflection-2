                <h1>Professional Growth Goal Reached?</h1>
                <p>
                  As I reread my professional growth goal after all these
                  months, something that really stood out to me was my goal to
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline"
                    >make sure students are learning</span
                  >
                  and also my goal to
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline"
                    >make sure students are engaged</span
                  >. For that reason, I have always loved student centered
                  learning. I do want to teach content, but more importantly I
                  want to be an educational coach for my students. I believe
                  this is so helpful in making sure that they take
                  accountability for their learning and also have fun at the
                  same time.

              Honest Reflection on my experience with virtual learning (the
              struggles):
            </h1>
            <p>
              With that being said, I do have to acknowledge that this year has
              been <span style="text-decoration: underline">ROUGH!</span> While
              I feel that I was able to establish a virtual classroom community
              with my fifth graders, it was just not the same as it could’ve,
              would’ve, or should’ve been in person (in my opinion). Something
              new I learned about fifth graders is that they are very shy to
              speak out loud through a computer and very shy to show themselves
              on camera as well. As a former shy student and introvert myself, I
              struggled with “forcing” them to turn on their cameras. Too often,
              it felt like I was talking to more black boxes than students. For
              these reasons, I really struggled to include the student centered
              learning strategies I love so much. And while I tried my very best
              to engage them, there were definitely days full of frustration and
              feeling disappointed that I wasn’t engaging my students enough.
              Not only that, but I also really struggled to help my students
              that needed the re-teaching and extra practice because they didn’t
              have the motivation to get the help they needed. For instance,
              they wouldn’t show up to small groups and at times were
              unresponsive in zoom. A lot of my students really struggled with
              poor internet connection, various distractions at home that may
              have included TV, phones, tablets, and some even had new
              responsibilities like taking care of their younger siblings. Not
              to mention it’s very hard to stare at a screen for hours at a
              time. I totally understand how difficult it has been for them.

              <h1>Surprising Myself (the celebrations):</h1>
              <p>
                Although I’m obviously not a fan of virtual learning, it wasn’t
                all bad. I have so many students that were working hard and
                showed so much growth. It’s truly amazing how resilient kids
                are. I am so proud of my students for never giving up and
                working hard even through a computer screen. So let’s get back
                to the question, did I reach my goal? The truth is yes and no.
                Every day at least one or more of my students were learning and
                were engaged. Even though it was not ALL of my students every
                day, I DID make a difference. So I guess you can say I did reach
                my goal at times. This was evident in the responses I would
                receive from my students on the microphone, chat box, and
                learning activities. I was so impressed with all the learning
                and student engagement that DID happen this year. This is what
                has kept me going despite how much I have personally struggled
                with virtual learning.

            <h1>You should never want to stop growing:</h1>
            <p>
              Because my growth goal discusses student learning and student
              engagement,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline"
                >I don’t think I’ll ever not have this growth goal</span
              >. You see, the thing I love about teaching is being able to see
              students having fun while learning. In fact, I think this is one
              of the biggest reasons why I have struggled with virtual learning.
              Since most of my students were so shy, I wasn’t always able to see
              their reactions and the
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">aha moments</span>. I
              don’t teach just to give information- that’s not fun! I teach
              because I want to see my students learn. For that reason, finding
              new ways to ensure student learning and student engagement will
              continue to be my goal as long as I am teaching.

              Teaching is so hard! How to stay passionate about something I
              love:
            </h1>
            <p>
              This is a hard question to answer because I’m still pretty new in
              the field of teaching. However, I do feel that being able to stay
              passionate about teaching will require for me to follow my own
              advice. I’ve always said my teaching philosophy is based on
              teaching and encouraging students to have a
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">growth mindset</span>. I
              also need to have a growth mindset to stay passionate about
              teaching. I enjoy keeping an open mind about new strategies that
              are engaging for students. I think this is something that will
              help me in the years to come.

            <h1>So you’re going to start teaching? Here’s my advice:</h1>
            <p>
              The most important piece of advice is to
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">never give up</span>!
              Teaching is honestly one of the hardest jobs. You have to love
              those
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">aha moments</span> when
              kids understand something. You also have to be willing to put in
              the work in order to get those
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">aha moments</span>- even
              if it takes re-teaching and multiple interventions. Putting in the
              work to help students learn makes it all so worth it. My other
              piece of advice is to
              <span style="text-decoration: underline"
                >set boundaries and have a life outside of teaching</span
              >. I take a lot of pride in the lessons and activities I create
              for student engagement. However, I also really enjoy stopping work
              no later than 3:30pm and not touching anything that has to do with
              work until the next morning. Another great tip is to prep
              everything you need for Monday on Friday in order to have a
              completely work free weekend, while still feeling ready for the
              new week.
