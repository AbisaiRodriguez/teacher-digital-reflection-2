                <h1>Professional Growth Goal Reached?</h1>
                <p>
                  As I reread my professional growth goal after all these months
                  something that really stood out to me was the goal to make
                  sure students are learning and also the goal to make sure
                  students are engaged. For that reason I have always loved
                  student centered learning. I want to teach content, but more
                  importantly I want to be an educational coach for my students.
                  I believe this is so helpful in making sure that they take
                  accountability for their learning and also have fun at the
                  same time.

              Honest Reflection on my experience with virtual learning (the
              struggles):
            </h1>
            <p>
              With that being said, I do have to acknowledge that this year has
              been ROUGH! While I feel that I was able to establish a virtual
              classroom community with my fifth graders, it was just not the
              same as it could’ve, would’ve, or should’ve been in person.
              Something new I learned about fifth graders is that they are very
              shy to speak out loud through a computer and very shy to show
              themselves on camera as well. For these reasons I really struggled
              to include the student centered learning strategies I love so
              much. And while I tried my very best to engage them, there were
              definitely days full of frustration and feeling disappointed that
              I wasn’t engaging my students enough. Not only that, but I also
              really struggled to help my students that needed the reteaching
              and extra practice because they didn’t have the motivation to get
              the help they needed. A lot of my students really struggled with
              poor internet connection, various distractions at home that may
              have included TV, phones, tablets, and some even had new
              responsibilities like taking care of their younger siblings. Not
              to mention it’s very hard to stare at a screen for hours at a
              time. I totally understand how difficult it has been for them.

              <h1>Surprising Myself (the celebrations):</h1>
              <p>
                Although I’m obviously not a fan of virtual learning, it wasn’t
                all bad. I have so many students that were working hard and
                showed so much growth. It’s truly amazing how resilient kids
                are. I am so proud of my students for never giving up and
                working hard even through a computer screen. So let’s get back
                to the question, did I reach my goal? The truth is yes and no.
                Every day at least 1 or more of my students were learning and
                were engaged. Even though it was not ALL of my students EVERY
                DAY, I DID make a difference. This was evident in the responses
                I would receive from my students on the microphone, chat box,
                and learning activities. I was so impressed with all the
                learning and student engagement that DID happen this year. This
                is what has kept me going despite how much I have personally
                struggled with virtual learning.

            <h1>You should never want to stop growing:</h1>
            <p>
              Because my growth goal discusses student learning and student
              engagement, I don’t think I’ll ever not have this growth goal. You
              see, the thing I love about teaching is being able to see students
              having fun while learning. In fact, I think this is one of the
              biggest reasons why I have struggled with virtual learning. Since
              most of my students were so shy, I wasn’t always able to see their
              reactions and the aha moments. I don’t teach just to give
              information- that’s not fun! I teach because I want to see my
              students learn. For that reason, finding new ways to ensure
              student learning and student engagement will continue to be my
              goal as long as I am teaching.

              Teaching is so hard! How to stay passionate about something I
              love:
            </h1>
            <p>
              This is a hard question to answer because i’m still pretty new in
              the field of teaching. However, I do feel that being able to stay
              passionate about teaching will require for me to follow my own
              advice. I’ve always said my teaching philosophy is based on
              teaching and encouraging students to have a growth mindset. I also
              need to have a growth mindset to stay passionate about teaching. I
              enjoy keeping an open mind about new strategies that are engaging
              for students. I think this is something that will help me in the
              years to come.

            <h1>So you’re going to start teaching? Here’s my advice:</h1>
            <p>
              The most important piece of advice is to never give up! Teaching
              is honestly one of the hardest jobs. You have to love those aha
              moments when kids understand something. You also have to be
              willing to put in the work in order to get those aha moments- even
              if it takes re-teaching and multiple interventions. Putting in the
              work to help students learn makes it all so worth it. My other
              piece of advice is to set boundaries and have a life outside of
              teaching. I take a lot of pride in the lessons and activities I
              create for student engagement. However, I also really enjoy
              stopping work no later than 3:30 and not touching anything that
              has to do with work until the next morning. Another great tip is
              to prep everything you need for Monday on Friday in order to have
              a completely work free weekend while still feeling ready for the
              new week.
