            Time to Reflect on my Professional Growth
          </h1>
          <p>
            If there’s something I’ve taken away from teaching it’s this:
            providing meaningful learning experiences to students that are
            engaging are non negotiable if you want your students to succeed. As
            teachers, we can spend hours planning instruction or even just a
            specific lesson, but if that instruction or lesson is not catered
            specifically to the students’ academic needs or interests (i.e. not
            engaging) it may not be effective at all. With this in mind, at the
            beginning of this year, I decided that I wanted my overall goal to
            be tied to this, and then some! I decided that my long term goal as
            a teacher would be to be able to provide an effective learning
            environment for my students, in which their specific needs were met.
            I also wanted to make it a goal to provide a learning environment
            that included engaging learning opportunities for my students. Did I
            succeed? Some days I did! Some days I did not. It’s all a part of
            the process!

          <p>
            Did I have any growth this year? Yes I did! Was it in every single
            area? No, it wasn’t. Being a teacher is without a doubt one of the
            hardest jobs, ever. It would be absolutely amazing if I was able to
            grow in every single area. However, it’s only my first year and my
            goal was to show progress, especially in my long term goal. With
            that being said, as I compared the initial and final assessments of
            year one I found specific areas in which I showed some growth in.
            The rest of the CSTP’s I stayed in the same category as I did in the
            initial.

            Overall, I think these areas of strength reflect my growth this
            year. For instance, my district as a whole focuses on essential
            standards. Something we do while teaching these standards is
            frequently assess students and plan instruction based on our
            findings. Since we did it constantly, I felt that I was able to
            assess students frequently and effectively throughout the year to
            help my students grow! The other CSTP’s are also ones that I feel I
            have grown in, especially CSTP 2. I talk a little bit more about it
            in the next section.

            I took a look at the CSTP’s where I have room for growth and I’m
            definitely not surprised! Something I found challenging this year as
            a first year teacher was feeling like a “master” in 5th grade
            curriculum. While I did understand the content enough to teach it
            and try my best to make it engaging, I really believe that it takes
            some years to feel comfortable enough to get really creative and
            innovative with it. As a first year teacher, it’s hard to be there
            because I really feel that it’s something that comes with experience
            and time. This also includes being able to say and feel that I’m
            ALWAYS going the extra mile to meet every diverse learner’s needs.
            That was my main goal this year and will probably continue to be my
            main goal as I go on. As I mentioned before, engaging learning for
            students is simply non negotiable.

            </h1>
            <p class="pt-3">
              On a more serious note, something that I’ve taken a lot of pride
              in and felt truly challenged in was CSTP 2- Creating and
              maintaining an effective learning environment for my students. The
              reason why I feel the most pride in this specific CSTP is because
              part of my teaching philosophy is to provide an effective learning
              environment where my students can thrive, feel safe, cared for,
              and happy. I’d be lying if I said I was able to provide this every
              minute of every day in my classroom because I did have some
              extremely challenging behaviors arise throughout the year.
              However, I really tried every day to provide this to my students
              with routines/procedures, incentives, clear expectations,
              consequences, engaging activities, and most importantly, sharing
              my love of learning with them. If I had given up, not very much
              learning would have been happening. This first group of students I
              had in my class became a classroom community that I will always
              remember and cherish. This is without a doubt one of the biggest
              accomplishments this past year. It’s something I will strive for
              each year.

              When I think about how to answer this question, it’s kind of hard
              because I have only been officially teaching for a year. So, when
              I think about it, I feel that I’m really answering the question
              What have I learned? There are two main things I feel are worth
              mentioning. The first thing thatI have learned is how to work
              collaboratively with my grade level team effectively. Our school
              district heavily believes and encourages working as a PLC
              (professional learning community). Being with a very focused team
              really helped me be successful in many ways. For instance, I would
              consider myself to be characterized as very introverted and at
              times shy, but I learned how to speak up and share my two cents
              during our collaborations. The second thing I’ve really learned is
              that student-teacher relationships are also a non negotiable
              thing. When I say that I had extremely challenging behavior issues
              arise, I’m not exaggerating! As teachers we are human beings, and
              have feelings, emotions, and yes our patience eventually runs out!
              However, I eventually learned to not take things personal! I had
              to work on my relationships with my students because at the end of
              the day, they needed to know and feel that I believed in them.
              Especially with fifth grade level standards that are so
              challenging!
